\section{Error bars}\label{sec:error_bar}

All experiments have been conducted three times, and we present the standard deviations of our model and the runner-up model here. The comparisons between our method and the second-best method, PatchTST~\citep{nie2022time}, on long-term forecasting tasks, are delineated in \shortautoref{tab:errorbar_long}. In this table, the average MSE and MAE have been reported across four ETT datasets, complete with standard deviations. Furthermore, \shortautoref{tab:errorbar_short} contrasts the effectiveness of our method with that of the second-best method, N-HiTS~\citep{challu2022nhits}, employing varying M4 datasets for the comparison.
