\section{Ablation Study}

\input{tables/ablation-study-full}

The full ablation results are in \shortautoref{tab:full-ablations}. We additionally compare the model performance under reprogramming and fine-tuning (with QLoRA~\cite{dettmers2023qlora}) protocols. Our results indicate a clear performance gain of our approach compared to the QLoRA variant (\textbf{A.5}) by \textbf{19\%} in average.
