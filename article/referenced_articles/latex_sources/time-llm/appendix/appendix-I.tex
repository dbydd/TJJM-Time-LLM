\section{Visualization}
In this part, we visualize the forecasting results of \method compared with the state-of-the-art and representative methods (e.g., GPT4TS~\citep{zhou2023one}, PatchTST~\citep{nie2022time}, and Autoformer~\citep{wu2021autoformer}) in various scenarios to demonstrate the superior performance of \method. 

In \shortautoref{fig:visual_etth1} and \shortautoref{fig:visual_m4}, the long-term (input-96-predict-96) and short-term (input-36-predict-36) forecasts of various approaches are compared with the ground truth. Here, \method showcases forecasting accuracy that is notably superior compared to GPT4TS, PatchTST, and a classical Transformer-based method, Autoformer. 

We also offer visual comparisons of the forecasting results in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, as depicted in \shortautoref{fig:visual_ettm1} and \shortautoref{fig:visual_etth1_etth2}. We adhere to the long-term (input-96-predict-96) forecasting setup in both cases. \method exhibits remarkable superiority in forecasting with limited dataâ€”a fact that becomes particularly salient when compared to GPT4TS.
